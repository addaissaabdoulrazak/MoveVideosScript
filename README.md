This C# console application scans a specified folder (Cours désordonner), finds video files inside its subdirectories, and moves them into a target folder (Ne confondez plus). If a file with the same name already exists, it automatically renames the new file to prevent overwriting.

Features:
✔ Scans multiple subfolders for videos (.mp4, customizable)
✔ Moves videos to a single target directory
✔ Handles duplicate filenames by renaming them
✔ Error handling for missing folders or permissions

This C# console application scans a specified folder (Cours d√©sordonner), finds video files inside its subdirectories, and moves them into a target folder (Ne confondez plus). If a file with the same name already exists, it automatically renames the new file to prevent overwriting.

Features:
‚úî Scans multiple subfolders for videos (.mp4, customizable)
‚úî Moves videos to a single target directory
‚úî Handles duplicate filenames by renaming them
‚úî Error handling for missing folders or permissions



Your comment is partially accurate, but it could be more precise.

‚úÖ Correct Part
Yes, Path.Combine() is used to construct a specific file or folder path in a platform-independent way. It ensures that directory separators (\ or /) are correctly placed based on the operating system.

‚ùå What Could Be Improved?
The phrase "if you want to get a specific path" is a bit vague. Path.Combine() doesn‚Äôt "get" an existing path; it constructs a path by combining multiple parts.
Better Comment Suggestion:

// Use Path.Combine() to safely construct a file or folder path.
Or
// Path.Combine() joins multiple path segments into a valid file path.


Here are some examples of how Path.Combine() works:

NB: Follow these steps // the steps below

1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic Example (Joining Folder and File)

string folder = @"C:\Users\John\Documents";

string fileName = "report.pdf";

string fullPath = Path.Combine(folder, fileName);

Console.WriteLine(fullPath);  
// Output: C:\Users\John\Documents\report.pdf

‚úÖ Path.Combine() ensures that the folder and file are properly joined with \.


2Ô∏è‚É£ Joining Multiple Folders

string part1 = @"C:\Users";

string part2 = "John";

string part3 = "Desktop";

string fullPath = Path.Combine(part1, part2, part3);

Console.WriteLine(fullPath);  
// Output: C:\Users\John\Desktop
‚úÖ You can combine multiple path segments at once.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Avoiding Incorrect Separators

string folder = @"C:\Users\John\Documents\";  // Has trailing backslash

string file = "notes.txt";

string fullPath = Path.Combine(folder, file);

Console.WriteLine(fullPath);  
// Output: C:\Users\John\Documents\notes.txt  ‚úÖ (No double `\\`)

‚úÖ Even if folder ends with \, Path.Combine() avoids duplicate slashes.


4Ô∏è‚É£ Example from Your Code

string destinationFolder = @"D:\Ne confondez plus";

string videoFileName = "video1.mp4";

string destinationFile = Path.Combine(destinationFolder, videoFileName);

Console.WriteLine(destinationFile);
// Output: D:\Ne confondez plus\video1.mp4
‚úÖ This is how your script correctly builds the destination file path before moving videos.
